      <h3>Welcome to Phonebook!</h3>
      <p>
        Have you ever had an appointment with a friend or a business meeting in
        a new place unknown to you, but unfortunately you forgot your smartphone
        or your battery has run out and you were not able to contact this
        person?
      </p>
      <p>
        Or maybe your smartphone has ever crashed and you have lost most of your
        contacts?
      </p>
      <p>
        In these and other situations, the solution may be the Phonebook, which
        is an application for storing your contacts and redirecting you to call
        them.
      </p>
    </>
